## How it works
<p>A Player needs to use his/her reflexes and try to stop the timer at exact 10.<br/>
The more closer to 10, the higher the scores will be.<br/>
A perfect 10, would get a huge shotout.</p>
<p>Players can see their current session in the right-side panel <br/>
Top scores are also visible in the left-side panel</p>
